Hello, I am a Ph.D. student at Central China Normal University (CCNU), advised by Prof. [Heng-Tong Ding](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1259382?ui-citation-summary=true). Before joining CCNU, I earned my bachelor's degree from Northeast Normal University. In Fall 2022, I began a long-term exchange program at Brookhaven National Laboratory, under the guidance of Senior Scientist [Swagato Mukherjee](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1036483?ui-citation-summary=true). 

My research primarily focuses on exploring the fundamental structure of hadrons using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Understanding the hadron structure is crucial for uncovering the dynamics of the strong interaction, which is one of the fundamental forces in nature. Lattice QCD results on hadron structure provide the theoretical predictions from the first principle that guide and interpret experimental measurements at facilities like Jefferson Lab (JLab) and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC). In addition to hadron structure, I am also interested in QCD thermodynamics, which explores the behavior of QCD matter under extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and strong magnetic fields.

In my leisure time, I enjoy:

- 🎤 **Singing** and 💃 **Dancing**
- 👫 Hangout with friends
- ✈️ Traveling with my boyfriend
- 🏊 Swimming
