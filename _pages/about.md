Hello, I am a Ph.D. student at Central China Normal University (CCNU), advised by Prof. [Hengtong Ding](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1259382?ui-citation-summary=true). Before joining CCNU, I earned my bachelor's degree from Northeast Normal University. In Fall 2022, I began a long-term exchange program at Brookhaven National Laboratory, under the guidance of Prof. [Swagato Mukherjee](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1036483?ui-citation-summary=true). My research interests lie in the fields of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD). I am particularly focused on exploring questions in QCD using lattice methods.

In my leisure time, I enjoy:

- **Singing** and **Dancing**
- Playing with friends
- Traveling with my boyfriend
